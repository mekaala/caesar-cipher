The Caesar Cipher is an encryption technique that shifts characters from their original letters or numbers to values that are a set distance away from them.
For example, the letter A becomes letter B with a shift of 1.

Other examples:
A => E, shift of 5
B => D, shift of 2

This repo will serve as my introduction to cybersecurity protocols, and will lend me practice towards more secure encryption and decryption methods.
